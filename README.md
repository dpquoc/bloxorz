# Super AI Solver for BLOXORZ

This project uses search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*, Monte Carlo Tree Search) to to solve the game BLOXORZ.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can either run the `run.bat` file or start a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to install the required libraries using pip and the `prerequisites.txt` file. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```pip install -r prerequisites.txt```


## Usage

To display usage information for this project, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```python main.py -h```

This will display information on how to use the `main.py` script and its available options.

**Note:** If you enable visualization using the `-v` or `--visualization` flag, you may need to capture your own images and place them in the `img` folder for the visualization to work correctly. The images you capture should be similar to the original images to some extent, and their filenames must match the existing images. This is because the visualization feature searches for images on the screen to perform actions.
